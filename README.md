# Basic Structs Example

## Quickstart

Clone the repo; install dependencies.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yan-man/sample-structs.git
$ npm install
```

To see the struct setters and getters in action:

```shell
$ npx hardhat test
```

`Sample.sol` shows the contract where sample structs are defined.
